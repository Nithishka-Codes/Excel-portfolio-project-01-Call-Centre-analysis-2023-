📊 Call Centre Analysis Dashboard (2023)
Excel Portfolio Project – 01
This project analyses call centre performance across multiple regions, representatives, and customer segments using Microsoft Excel. It includes KPIs, trend charts, demographic insights, and satisfaction ratings to help stakeholders make data‑driven decisions.

🚀 Project Overview
Call centres generate large volumes of operational data, but without proper analysis, it becomes difficult to identify performance gaps, customer trends, and revenue opportunities.
This project transforms raw call data into an interactive Excel dashboard that highlights:
	• Call volume trends
	• Revenue performance
	• Representative rankings
	• Customer demographics
	• Satisfaction ratings
	• City‑wise and customer‑wise breakdowns

🛠️ Tools & Techniques Used
	• Microsoft Excel
	• Pivot Tables
	• Pivot Charts
	• Slicers & Filters
	• Conditional Formatting
	• KPI Cards
	• Lookup Functions
	• Data Cleaning
	• Basic Data Modelling

📌 Key Dashboard Features
1. KPI Summary
	• Total Calls: 1,000
	• Total Amount: $96,623
	• Total Duration: 89,850 seconds
	• Average Rating: 3.9
	• Happy Customers: 307

2. Monthly Trend Analysis
A line chart visualizes:
	• Monthly call volume

Helps identify peak and low‑performance months.

3. Representative Performance
For each representative (R01–R05):
	• Calls handled
	• Revenue generated
	• Call rank
	• Amount rank

Comparison of male vs female callers across:
	• Cincinnati

6. Customer‑Level Revenue Table
A detailed table shows:
	• Customer IDs
	• Revenue generated per representative
	• Highlighted low‑value or flagged transactions

7. Customer Satisfaction Ratings
Ratings from 1 to 5 are summarized with total revenue per rating group.

📈 Insights & Findings

	• Saturday sees the highest call volume.
	• Columbus has the highest number of male callers.
	• Several customers show consistently low revenue — potential churn risk.
